# Visual fidelity corrections — September 8, 2026

The first editor was an approximation. User feedback correctly identified that it did not match Screen Studio. Visual parity remains open.

## Evidence and changes

Read-only inspection of Screen Studio 3.7.5's installed renderer definitions yielded the following layout values. The obfuscated string lookup was decoded locally; no vendor source is included in this repository.

| Surface | Reference evidence | Correction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Editor background | Theme background `#08090D` | Replaced warm gray canvas and header backgrounds |
| Sidebar | Theme backgroundAccent `#13151b` | Replaced warm purple gray |
| Primary control | Theme primary `#4d2ff5` | Updated Export accent |
| Editor body | RecordingEditor video/sidebar padding `16px 14px 0`, gap 2px | Inset the content accordingly |
| Sidebar | 320px width, 8px radius | Rounded and clipped inset panel |
| Timeline | Separate sibling below video/sidebar container | Extended timeline across editor width |
| Layout toolbar | Centered horizontal control groups | Removed invented floating glass enclosure |
| Recording bar | Live screenshot 855 × 64 | Removed 8px wrapper inset and corrected native window bounds |
| Close recorder | Live screenshot circular light button | Replaced plain X with light circular treatment |

The reference editor screenshot repeatedly returned white while accessibility content remained available. This means the measured constants have not yet received a full visual comparison. The native app inspection subsequently timed out. No visual-parity claim is warranted from a successful build alone.

## CSS correction

The global reset was unlayered while StyleX emits cascade layers. This let broad reset rules override component font, color, and outline declarations. The reset now lives in a lower-priority `reset` layer, before the generated StyleX layers. Keyboard focus styles remain defined.

## Next comparisons

Check at equal logical window sizes: titlebar alignment; preview bounds; tab spacing; wallpaper category/thumbnail density; slider tracks and reset affordances; transport alignment; clip/zoom track colors and dimensions; recorder input widths, icons, and popovers. Original wallpaper artwork and Lucide icons still differ from the reference.

## Packaged-app check

The corrected Apple Silicon app bundle launched successfully. The 855 × 64 recorder was visually checked, then the generated twelve-second fixture was imported through the native file picker. The editor displayed the inset sidebar and full-width timeline, and saving returned “Project saved.” A second correction replaced unsupported StyleX border shorthands with explicit width/style/color properties after the first visual check exposed browser-default button outlines. Captions now occupies the fourth sidebar tab, matching the reference accessibility tree. Final screenshot comparison remains pending for that last correction.
